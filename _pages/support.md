# RPMmtr
RPM measurement is  useful to measure the state of a machine...
Rotating machinery  generates characteristic sound patterns . 
Examples are motors in washing machines, ships and chain saws.
RPMmtr  analyses these sound patterns to estimate rotational speed in RPM.
Rpmmtr  analyses these patterns to estimate rotational speed in RPM.
The color of the dent indicates how clear the measurement is.
Swipe the red ring and improve the result by specifing the RPM range.
Also improve the result by specifying the machine type.
Track RPM over time.
Experts use the spectrogram view: understand how the algorithm comes to its result.

Axis adjustable with one finger 

Sound based rpm estimation
Rpmmtr uses state of the art pattern recognition/ signal  technology to estimate rotational speed
