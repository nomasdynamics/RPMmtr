# RPMmtr
Rotating machinery like engines and electric motors can be found in cars, chainsaws, wasching machines and on boats.
Those devices generate characteristic sound patterns. RPMmtr  analyses these sound patterns to estimate rotational speed in RPM.
The result of this estimation is sown in three different views. The tachometer view shows the roational speed at a glance.
The color of the dent indicates how clear the measurement is. You can swipe the red ring control and improve the result by specifing the expected RPM range.
The tracking view shows the evolution of the rotational speed over time. The accuracy of the measurement is indicated by the size and color of the circles.
Experts can use the spectrogram view: understand how the algorithm comes to its result.

Axis adjustable with one finger 

Sound based rpm estimation
Rpmmtr uses state of the art pattern recognition/ signal  technology to estimate rotational speed
