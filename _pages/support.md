# Measuring rotational speed with RPMmtr
Cars, chainsaws, washing machines, and boats generate engine or motor sounds.. The tone of this sound is closely linked to rotational speed. The reason are period sound patterns. RPMmtr analyses sound patterns to estimate rotational speed in RPM based on state-of-the-art signal processing technology.
The result of this estimation is shown in three different views. The tachometer view displays the rotational speed at a glance.
The color of the dent indicates how clear the measurement is. You can swipe the red ring control and improve the result by specifying the expected RPM range.
The tracking view shows the evolution of the rotational speed over time. The accuracy of the measurement is indicated by the size and color of the circles.
Experts can use the spectrogram view: the graph shows the frequency distribution of the sound. Small arrows show the rotational speed.
In the tracking view and in the spectrogram view the axes scaling is adjustable by a swipe with one finger.

# Notice on usage
The app can estimate the correct rotational speed only in cases if the sound is very clear (the rotating device generates clear peridic sound patterns with one frequency) and there is no background noise.
