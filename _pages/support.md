# RPMmtr
Rotating machinery like engines and electric motors is built in cars, chainsaws, washing machines, and boats.
Those devices generate characteristic sound patterns. RPMmtr analyses these sound patterns to estimate rotational speed in RPM.
The result of this estimation is sown in three different views. The tachometer view shows the rotational speed at a glance.
The color of the dent indicates how clear the measurement is. You can swipe the red ring control and improve the result by specifying the expected RPM range.
The tracking view shows the evolution of the rotational speed over time. The accuracy of the measurement is indicated by the size and color of the circles.
Experts can use the spectrogram view: the graph shows the frequency distribution of the sound. Small arrows show the rotational speed.
In the tracking view and in the spectrogram view the axes adjustable by a swipe with one finger.
